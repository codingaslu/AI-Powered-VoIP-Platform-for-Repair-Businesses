# AI-Powered VoIP Platform for Repair Businesses

## High-Level Overview
To build this platform, we need to combine three main layers: communication infrastructure (VoIP & messaging), an AI engine for automation, and a clean user interface to manage everything.

## Breakdown by Components

### 1. Communication Layer
We'd use **Twilio** for VoIP calls and SMS. It handles incoming/outgoing calls, voicemail, **missed call detection**, and routing logic.

### 2. Transcription Engine
We'd stream audio (via Twilio Media Streams) to an external transcription model like **Whisper or AssemblyAI**, then store the text.

### 3. AI Automation
Once we have the transcript, we'd use a **language model** (like GPT-4 or Claude) to:
* Summarize calls
* Generate follow-ups
* **Automatically respond to missed calls** with personalized messages
* Convert voicemails to text messages

### 4. Inbox UI
Build a unified web-based inbox using **React or Vue + FastAPI backend**, where users can see all calls, texts, and AI-suggested responses. This would include responsive design for mobile access and **missed opportunity alerts**.

### 5. Backend Infrastructure
Use **PostgreSQL for metadata**, **Qdrant for vector search**, and host everything on **Cloud Run, Heroku, or Kubernetes** depending on scale.

### 6. Integration & Security
Implement secure API endpoints for integration with existing business systems (CRMs, ticketing systems) and ensure end-to-end encryption for all communications.

## Timeline & Team
For an MVP, we could ship a working version in about **5–6 weeks**:
- Week 1–2: Twilio setup + routing + **missed call detection**
- Week 3–4: Inbox UI + transcription
- Week 5–6: AI integrations + polish

The system would be designed with scalability in mind, able to efficiently grow from dozens to thousands of users through containerization and load balancing.

## Conclusion
Since I've already built GenAI products with messaging, vector search, and AI responses, I could prototype the core AI layer quickly and iterate based on user feedback. **The missed call functionality would be a priority feature as it directly impacts revenue recovery.**
